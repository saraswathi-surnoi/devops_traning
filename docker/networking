networking:
- The networking is used to talk the two containers with each other.
- The netwoking has a isolation also
- Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host system. 
- Containers run isolated from the host system and need a way to communicate with each other and with the host system.

- the list of networks 
- docker network ls
Bridge Networking:
- The default network mode in Docker.
- It creates a private network between the host and containers, allowing containers to communicate with
 each other and with the host system.
- If you want to secure your containers and isolate them from the default bridge network you can also 
create your own bridge network.
To create a network we use command 
- docker network create -d bridge my_bridge
This new network can be attached to the containers, when you run these containers.
- docker run -d --net=my_bridge --name db training/postgres.
