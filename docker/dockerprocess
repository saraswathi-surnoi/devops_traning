create one directory -->mkdir myapp --> cd myapp --> create on file and write the conent on it --> vim dockerfile--> write the nginx baseimage or write the install of nginx--> from the dockerfile we get docker image 
After creating of docker image check the docker info if the docker deamon is running or not 
if it is not running then start it using the command 
-sudo service docker start 
-then it started so we have to build a image from the dockerfile --
- docker build -t (tag) or flag directoryname/myapp .
- check the images using --> docker images
- After the image created we have to run that image and we craete a container 
- docker run -d -p 8080:80 myapp
-Here we have to add the tags for that 
-docker tag (name of ur source) dockerhub username/(desination)
-docker tag myapp sarusparks/myapp:latest
-After the docker container created check it 
-docker ps -a 
then push it into the docker hub or registry 
- create a dockerhub 
-Then give the docker login --> username --> password --> after login to docker hub push the container or image to dockerhub
- docker push sarusparks/myapp:latest
- Then check the docker image is pushed successfully or not
